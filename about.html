<p>Former logistics manager turned software engineer with experience in JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, SQL, and React / Redux. I am excited to strategically leverage my background in logistics, communicating with clients, and shipping operations in a full-stack engineering role at a company focused on creating a positive impact.</p>
<br>
<p>I started as a self-taught blog writer using Wordpress with simple HTML/CSS and Google AdSense. My passionate about programming grows and I decided to take a Software Engineering Bootcamp at Flatiron School.</p>
<br>
<p>I seek a role as a web developer at a company where I can learn, grow, continue to master the craft, and make people happy.</p>
