Git Hub Universe is a two-day event held at the Palace of Fine Art in San Francisco. It celebrates over 40 million developers and their contributions to the open source community.

It was my first big tech event to attend. I was so excited and can’t express appreciation to the GitHub which somewhat sent me the event invitation (Thank you so much!)

Most interesting talks were keynotes. There were several exciting announcements such as:
* GitHub Actions
* GitHub Packages
* GitHub for mobile
* GitHub Security Lab 

And so on.

Also, GitHub announced GitHub Archive Program, which can preserve archived repositories in Svalbard, Norway. It lasts at least 1000 years for next future generations.
Isn’t is nice our repositories are preserved at such a beautiful place?

Thanks for all the demos and talks. It definitely gave me inspiration and motivation! I hope I can create or develop something visible or meaningful things in the near future. Also, I am so happy to say here that I completed my first open source project yesterday. It makes me so happy when my code was merged. Feels good!
