Git Hub Universe is a two-day event held at the Palace of Fine Art in San Francisco. It celebrates over 40 million developers and their contributions to the open source community.

It was my first big tech event that I attended. I was so excited and can’t express appreciation to the GitHub which somewhat sent me the event invitation (Thank you so much!)

One of the most interesting talks was keynotes (Both Day 1 and Day 2). There were several exciting announcements such as:
* GitHub Actions
* GitHub Packages
* GitHub for mobile
* GitHub Security Lab 

And so on.

Also, GitHub announced GitHub Archive Program, which can preserve archived repositories in Svalbard, Norway. It lasts at least 1000 years for next future generations.
Isn’t it nice to know that our repositories are preserved at such a beautiful place?

Thanks for all the demos and talks. It definitely gave me inspiration and motivation! Also, I am so happy to say here that I completed my first open source project in GitHub yesterday. I wasn't sure first where I can start and how to find the appropriate project but I am glad that I finally found the open source project which I can contribute. It makes me so happy when my code was merged. Feels good!
